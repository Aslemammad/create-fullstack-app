## ðŸ“œ About

{{ projectDescription }}

This project was bootstrapped with [create-fullstack-app](https://github.com/Divlo/create-fullstack-app).

#### ðŸš¨ TODO: Update Icons

By default the icons are the TypeScript logo in various sizes located in the folder [/website/public/images/icons](./website/public/images/icons).

You can easily generate you own icons of various sizes thanks to [Web App Manifest Generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/).
